# github-back-button

Greasemonkey userscript to restore the functionality of the back button on github pull requests when navigating to the commits/files tabs.

Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (in firefox, I think there's Greasemonkey or similar for chrome but I haven't tested it myself) then [clicking on the raw view of the javascript file](https://github.com/carols10cents/github-back-button/raw/master/github-back-button.user.js) should prompt you to install it in Greasemonkey. [Feel free to inspect it first!](https://github.com/carols10cents/github-back-button/blob/master/github-back-button.user.js)

Now go to a pull request! Now click the Files tab! Now use the back button! Now rejoice!
