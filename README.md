# github-back-button

Greasemonkey userscript to restore the functionality of the back button on github pull requests when navigating to the commits/files tabs.

Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (in firefox, I think there's Greasemonkey or similar for chrome but I haven't tested it myself) then add the user.js as a user script.
